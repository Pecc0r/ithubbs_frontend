= Use of Bootstrap for styling the views

= Status: accepted

= Context
Bootstrap is successfully used by lots of companies and projects and provides more than just styling (e.g. burger menus). There are three options:

1. Add Bootstrap manually. 
1. https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home[ng-Bootstrap]
1. https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap[ngx-Bootstrap]

According to https://stevenschwenke.de/addingBootstrapToAnAngularApplicationThatGotGeneratedWithJHipster[this analyzis] it's clear that options 2 and 3 are to favor.

Compared to ngx-bootstrap, ng-Bootstrap is the older library. However, there has been a long pause in the development during which ngx-bootstrap was developed as a replacement / successor. After development of ng-bootstrap continued, both of these options are pretty equal.

Experts like Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and Angular-Schule don't have any preferences.  


= Decision
ngx-bootstrap is chosen because it the library with the most continuous development.

= Consequences
None known.
